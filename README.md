# Markdown Viewer

This project provides a simple, single-page web application designed to render Markdown files (`.md`) into clean, responsive HTML using **Marked.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features

*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: Automatically fetches `input.md` and converts its content into HTML.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great user experience across various device sizes.
*   **Single File Application**: All necessary code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is contained within `index.html` for easy deployment and sharing.
*   **Client-Side Rendering**: Markdown conversion happens directly in the browser.

## Getting Started

To run this application, simply save the `index.html` file and the `input.md` file in the same directory. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to view this application.

### Usage

1.  Place your Markdown content in a file named `input.md` in the same directory as `index.html`.
2.  Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
3.  The content of `input.md` will be rendered as HTML on the page.
